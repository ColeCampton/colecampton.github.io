Hello my name is Cole Campton. I was born and raised in Mill Valley, California. I graduated from Reed College with a B.A. in mathematics. While at Reed I wrote a thesis on the homological equivalence of discrete configure space models used in motion planning. 

I am currently a graduate student at Duke University's Computer Science department. 

I am interested in computer science, mathematics, rock climbing, coffee and lever espresso machines.

Feel free to contact me.  Let's talk computer science and coffee.
