To me preparing coffee is a calming ritual that allows me to seek perfection, the godshot, as it is called. It's a satisfying pursuit that rewards us with delicous coffee along the way. 

In the process we learn what is important in making great coffee: the beans, the roast, grind, the ratio, the brew time, the machine. 
## The Beans
### Arabica versus Robusta

## The Roast

Above we see differences in the roast time of the same beans with equivalent mass.
## The Grind
Much has been learned about how grinders effect the extraction of coffee. The general consensus has been that burr grinders create a more consistent grind than blade grinders. 
Within the family of burr grinders there are both conical and flat burr grinders. The difference in design between these two categories leads to differences in the distribution of volume and mass of particles produced. It is believed that flat burr grinders are perferable for espresso due to the fine-heavy grind, while conical grinders are preferable for pour over. 

### The Titan Grinder Project
While the preferential nature of what a 'good' cup of coffee prevents a correlation between 'good' coffee and these factors, the Titan Grinder project has sought to measure how grinding equiptment effects the grind produced.

Titan grinders: the Macap MXK conical burr grinder, the Mazzer Robur conical burr grinder, and the Mazzer Super Jolly flat burr grinder

The project used a single QuickMill Vetrano espresso machine and with each of three grinders adjusted grind to achieve a 60mL shot in 30 seconds with a 19g dose of the same roast of a Kenyan bean. The concept being that holding volume, shot extraction time constant, mass, bean and roast constant
